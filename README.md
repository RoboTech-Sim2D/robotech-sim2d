## 🚀 About Us

**RoboTech** is a new Mexican competitive research team dedicated to the **RoboCup Soccer 2D Simulation League**. 
Building on the strong legacy of *Cyrus2D* and *Helios*, our goal is to push the boundaries of multi-agent systems (MAS) and artificial intelligence.

Our main objective is to develop autonomous agents capable of making complex decisions and playing cooperatively in dynamic environments. We also aim to keep Soccer 2D Simulation in the spotlight for Mexican and Latin American developers. 

## 🧠 Key Features & Research

We are continuously evolving our codebase with a focus on:

*   **⚡ Dynamic Formations**: Real-time strategy adaptation based on opponent modeling.
*   **🛡️ Cooperative Defense**: Sophisticated marking systems and offside trap coordination.
